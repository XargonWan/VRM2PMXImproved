# How To Use
Download the Zip from the Release section, extract it, and run VRM2PMX.exe.

- When you select a VRM file in the main window, the avatar will be displayed in the preview screen.
- Click "Convert" and select a folder to output the PMX file.
- If you want to set facial expressions, do it in the EXTRA section below. Adjust while looking at the avatar. After setting, click "Convert" to convert.
* At this time, a VRM with the set facial expressions will also be output. If you want to continue working on facial expressions next time, load this VRM.
